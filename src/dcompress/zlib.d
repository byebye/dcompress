 + The library supports only one compression method called `deflate`, which may
 + be wrapped around with `zlib` or `gzip` headers.
 + The `zlib` format was designed to be compact and fast, for use in memory and
 + on communications channels, makes use of `Adler-32` for integrity check.
 + The `gzip` format was designed for a single file compression on file systems,
 + has a larger header than `zlib` to maintain file information, and uses
 + a slower `CRC-32` check method.

     +               a number from `1` - uses minimum memory but is slow and
